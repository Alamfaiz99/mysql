(it will give the desc of the tables means having all kind of desc of the table 
you ahve provided)
--->insert into table_name(attributes/fields data)values(enter data);
(in this way you can insert the values in the tables)
---->select * from table_name;
(you can see the actul content of the table)
---->insert into table values (),(),();
(in this way you can insert multiple values)
-->insert into table_name(attributes/fields)values(data);
(in this way you can add values in the specified column)
--->alter table table_name
    add column_name defination-->datatype ,NOT NULL

--->alter table table_name add primary key(field name);
(in this way you acn set any field as primary key)
--->alter table student drop primary key;
(in this way you can remove the primary key)

--->lets talk about unique keys
a UNIQUE index ensures that the value in the column must be unique
unlike primary key,it allows NULL values to the indices
a table can have multiple UNIQUE keys
it doesnolt ahve duplicate entries
---:>how to delete a particular field in a database table

SELECT COL1,COL2,COL3 FRON TBLE_NAME WHERE CON1 OR CON2 OR CON3;
SELECT COL1,COL2 FROM TABKLE_NAME WHERE NOT CON1;

-->SQL ORDER BY KEYWORD
THE ORDER BY KEYWORD IS USED TO SET THE RESULT IN ASCENDING/DESCENDING OREDR
BY DEFAULT-->ASCENDING ORDER
